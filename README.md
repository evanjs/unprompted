## üëã Introduction

Unprompted is a **powerful templating language** and **Swiss Army knife** for the [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

Built around `[shortcodes]`, Unprompted is uniquely designed for **maximum readibility with natural language.** This makes it **easy to learn and use**, even for those with no prior programming experience.

## üì¶ Features

- [x] Free
- [x] Includes **70+ shortcodes** out of the box - there are `[if]` conditionals, powerful `[file]` imports, `[choose]` blocks for flexible wildcards, and everything else the prompting enthusiast could possibly want
- [x] Easily extendable with **custom shortcodes**
- [x] Numerous Stable Diffusion features such as `[txt2mask]` and Bodysnatcher that are exclusive to Unprompted
- [x] Ability to organize your `.txt` templates into **folders and subfolders** according to your own preferences
- [x] As **a modern language**, Unprompted supports recursion, nested shortcodes, advanced logic operators, custom configs, pretty much all the good stuff one might expect from the 21st century
- [x] You can programmatically **read and write any Stable Diffusion variable** exposed by the WebUI, such as `negative_prompt` and `cfg_scale`
- [x] Supports **natural language processing features** such as auto-pluralization, finding synonyms, and even verb conjugation
- [x] Includes a growing list of examples that demonstrate advanced functionality, such as **customizing the weight of a choice list** and **applying emphasis to a random part of your prompt**
- [x] Comprehensive documentation that is always up-to-date
- [x] Made by an organic human lifeform

## üîß Installation

We provide two methods of installation:

<details><summary>How to install directly... (click to expand)</summary>

1. Visit the **Extensions** tab of Automatic's WebUI.
2. Visit the **Install from URL** subtab.
3. Paste this repo's URL into the first field: `https://github.com/ThereforeGames/unprompted`
4. Click **Install**.

</details>

<details><summary>How to install through extensions index... (click to expand)</summary>

1. Visit the **Extensions** tab of Automatic's WebUI.
2. Visit the **Available** subtab.
3. Uncheck the "ads" filter and press the **Load from** button.
4. Scroll down to **Unprompted** and press the **Install** button. (Or use CTRL+F for convenience)

</details>

With either method, **please be sure to restart your WebUI after installing.** This allows Unprompted to download its Python dependencies.

## üìö Usage

First, let's verify that your installation was successful by trying out an included template. Add this to your prompt:

`[call common/examples/human/main]`

This is a simple "person generator" that automatically chooses characteristics like hair color, race, and posture.

The `[call]` shortcode will look in `unprompted/templates` for the specified text file (so in this case `unprompted/templates/common/examples/human/main.txt`.) You do not need to enter the file extension.

**Example output:**

<details><summary>Recommended Regional Prompter settings</summary>

- Generation mode: Attention (this is faster than Latent mode, but works poorly with loras. However, you can easily add your loras in the zoom_enhance step!)
- Base Ratio: 0.2
- Use base prompt: Enabled, and make sure it matches the value of the `base_prompt` setting below
- Use common prompt: Disabled, this template implements its own "common prompt" in a way that is more flexible

<details><summary>Getting Started</summary>

Your first Unprompted template. It's a big step, I know. You feeling nervous? A sense of tremendous pressure maybe? Don't worry, it's not that hard to set this thing up.

For the purposes of this guide, we will construct a basic "human generator" similar to the one that is included with the repo download.

<details><summary>Step 1: Create the entry point</summary>

In the root directory of the WebUI app, navigate to `extensions/unprompted/templates`. This is where all your templates belong - you can organize the files here in any way you like.

Create a blank text file called `example.txt`. This will serve as the "entry point" for our new template.

Open up your new file and enter the following text:

```
Photo of a man
```

Save the file and boot up your Unprompted interface. I will be using [Automatic's repo](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) for this guide, but you can follow along with the standalone `unprompted_dry.py` if you prefer.

Now enter the following as your prompt and press generate:

```
[call example]
```

You can check the information underneath the resulting picture to confirm that Stable Diffusion received the correct prompt ("Photo of a man").

Cool! Now let's proceed to the good stuff...

<details><summary>Step 2: Using the [choose] shortcode</summary>

Let's ask Unprompted to choose between a man and a woman. This is easy to do:

```
Photo of a [choose]man|woman[/choose]
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** All of the code in this guide refers to our example.txt file unless otherwise noted. Remember to save your file with each change!

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You do NOT need to restart the web UI when making changes to your text files.

We can use the vertical pipe (i.e. `|`) to separate our options.

Now, what if we want to specify the hair color for our subject? We could do something like this...

`Photo of a [choose]red|blue|yellow|green[/choose]-haired [choose]man|woman[/choose]`

...but as you can imagine, the list of options can become quite lengthy and difficult to manage. There's a better way. **We will create a separate file called `color.txt` and put our colors there.** In programming, this is akin to an "object-oriented approach."

To make our life even easier, we can put our options on individual lines instead of relying on the vertical pipe.

So here's our new `color.txt`:

```
[choose]
red
blue
yellow
green
pink
[/choose]
```

Feel free to add a bunch of other colors - I'm keeping things brief for the guide.

Now, we can reference our new file in `example.txt` like this:

`Photo of a [call color]-haired [choose]man|woman[/choose]`

Yes, we are using a `[call]` shortcode inside of another file. This is perhaps one of the most powerful things about Unprompted!

Next, let's check out some other shortcodes we can use.

</details>

<details><summary>Step 3: Managing Stable Diffusion options with [set]</summary>

Unprompted has the ability to manage variables using `[set]` and `[get]`. You can create your own variables or even adjust the system variables used by the image generator.

At the bottom of `example.txt`, let's force a seed value of "1" to help with later debugging:

```
[set seed]1[/set]
```

For improved image quality, we can also force a CFG scale of 7 and turn on the "Restore Faces" option:

```
[set cfg_scale]7[/set]
[set restore_faces]1[/set]
```

Now no matter how we change the UI, our template will continue using these optimized values.

</details>

<details><summary>Step 4: Overriding parts of the template</summary>

Imagine a situation where you want the randomness a template offers, but you need to lock in a certain word or phrase of your choosing.

For example, maybe we want to generate a "panda" instead of a "man" or "woman." Do we have to destructively edit our template file? No! We can use the `[overrides]` shortcode for this. Here's how:

In `example.txt`, we need to wrap the man/woman phrase with a variable that will act like a category:

```
[set subject _out][choose]man|woman[/choose][/set]
```

I'm calling this variable `subject` but you can name it anything you like.

The `_out` argument indicates to Unprompted that we want to print this variable immediately for use in our prompt. Sometimes you don't want to do this, like when we set the CFG scale and Restore Faces earlier.

Now, inside of our web UI, we can change the prompt to this:

```
[overrides subject="panda"][call example]
```

That's it, now you've got pandas!

In the final section, we will learn about some more advanced functions.

</details>

<details><summary>Step 5: Conditional shortcodes</summary>

The last subject I want to discuss are the conditional shortcodes `[if]` and `[chance]`. These will evaluate given variable(s) in deciding what to output.

For our demo, we will run a check on the `subject` variable, and if it's set to `man`, we will make him wear a business suit 75% of the time. Here's how we can do this:

On a new line, we will write `wearing a business suit` inside of a conditional check...

```
[if subject="man"]wearing a business suit[/if]
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Unprompted will automatically convert any linebreaks in our template to spaces, and it will also remove unnecessary/double spaces at the end of the processing chain.

Finally, if we want to make this occur only 75% of the time, we introduce `[chance]`:

```
[if subject="man"][chance 75]wearing a business suit[/chance][/if]
```

He'd like to congratulate you on making it this far.

<details><summary>Setting up Replacement Terms</summary>

Do you regularly use LORA files or other embeddings in your Stable Diffusion prompts? If so, you probably know that it can be a challenge to keep track of all the different filenames, trigger words, and optimal weights to use in your prompts.

You can solve this by setting up replacement terms with Unprompted.

Let's say you have the following prompt with a couple LORA tags:

```
an amazing illustration of pepe_frog<lora:pepeFrog_v20:0.8> bloodstainai<lora:bloodstainedVector_v10:0.75>
```

You can use the `[replace]` shortcode to perform find-and-replace operations on the inner content. So if we specify `[replace red=blue]`, then all instances of "red" will be swapped to "blue."

Here's where it gets interesting: **we can load our replacement strings from external files.**

## Dictionary setup

In your `unprompted` folder, create a subdirectory called `user` and make a file called `replacements.json` inside of that (i.e. `unprompted/user/replacements.json`).

Open `replacements.json` in your text editor of choice.

Let's write our new dictionary with "from":"to" replacement pairings:

```
{
	"from something":"to something else"
}
```

In place of `from something`, we want to insert an easy-to-remember shorthand for the complicated LORA tag.

Looking at the example prompt, we'll use `pepe the frog` for the first tag. Here is our updated dictionary:

```
{
	"pepe the frog":"pepe_frog<lora:pepeFrog_v20:0.8>"
}
```

Now, let's add a comma and a linebreak for the next entry.

We don't want to use `bloodstained` as our shorthand because it's too generic - sometimes you may want to include "bloodstained" in your prompts without invoking the LORA embedding. So we'll use `in the style of bloodstained` instead. We can also add an **alternative replacement** such as `bloodstained style` with a vertical pipe delimiter.

Here is our dictionary with both entries:

```
{
	"pepe the frog":"pepe_frog<lora:pepeFrog_v20:0.8>",
	"in the style of bloodstained|bloodstained style":"bloodstainai<lora:bloodstainedVector_v10:0.75>"
}
```

Save the file. To use it in your prompts, you must set it to the `_load` value of your `[replace]` block as shown below:

```
[replace _load="user/replacements.json"]an amazing illustration of pepe the frog in the style of bloodstained[/replace]
```

And you're done!

## How to automatically include [replace] in your prompts

If you're happy with your dictionary, you probably don't want to manually write `[replace]` all the time. Luckily, you don't have to.

Create or open a file called `config_user.json` at `unprompted/lib_unprompted`.

Add an entry called `templates` as shown below:

```
{
	"templates":
	{
		"default":"[replace _load='user/replace.json']*[/replace]"
	}
}
```

The asterisk wildcard represents any prompt. Restart the WebUI and you're all set!

## Supercharging [replace] with additional options

I would like to bring a couple pargs (positional arguments) available in `[replace]` that may improve your workflow:

### _strict

This will prevent `[replace]` from processing the shortcodes in your JSON values *unless* the key matches a string in your content. In other words, you need to use this if you wish to add shortcodes to your dictionary values.

### _now

Runs the `[replace]` operations *before* executing any shortcodes in the content. For example, let's say you have a replacement query that includes the setting of a variable:

```
	"char_john_smith" : "male, brown hair[set name='John']"
```

And you have a prompt like this:

```
char_john_smith, [get name]
```

The `[get name]` will return an empty string because it runs *before* `[replace]` sets the variable.

So you must add `_now` to avoid this.

Putting both options together, your config setting may look like this:

```
{
	"templates":
	{
		"default":"[replace _load='user/replace.json' _now _strict]*[/replace]"
	}
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Using Metatags with Your [choose] Blocks</summary>

In this guide, we will utilize the `[tags]` and `[filter_tags]` shortcodes to create a more dynamic `[choose]` block.

Let's say we want to generate a random animal. We can use the following prompt:

```
[choose]
	dog
	cat
	lion
	tiger
	wolf
	lizard
	turtle
	crocodile
	newt
	salamander
	frog
[/choose]
```

But what if we want to generate a random animal that is also a reptile? We could create a separate `[choose]` block for reptiles, but that would be time-consuming and redundant. Instead, we can use the `[tags]` shortcode to filter our options.

We can sort our animals into three categories: `mammal`, `reptile`, and `amphibian`. Here's how we can do this:

```
[choose]
	[tags mammal]
		dog
		cat
		lion
		tiger
		wolf
	[/tags]
	[tags reptile]
		lizard
		turtle
		crocodile
	[/tags]
	[tags amphibian]
		newt
		salamander
		frog
	[/tags]
[/choose]
```

Now we can simply write `[filter_tags reptile]` before our `[choose]` block to select a random reptile.

Note that the `[tags]` shortcode is not limited to use with `[choose]` blocks. You can use it anywhere in your template to create grouped content that can be filtered by `[filter_tags]`.

We can also write multiple tags in a single `[tags]` block. Both reptiles and amphibians are known for laying eggs, so we can add a `lays_eggs` tag to both of those categories and use it as our filter criteria:

```
[filter_tags lays_eggs]
[choose]
	[tags mammal]
		dog
		cat
		lion
		tiger
		wolf
	[/tags]
	[tags reptile lays_eggs]
		lizard
		turtle
		crocodile
	[/tags]
	[tags amphibian lays_eggs]
		newt
		salamander
		frog
	[/tags]
[/choose]
```

Now it will only select animals that lay eggs - either a reptile or an amphibian.

For our final example, let's say we want to generate a mammal that is **not** a feline. To achieve this, we will first create `feline` and `canine` genus tags within the mammal category (yes, we can use nested `[tags]`!):

```
[choose]
	[tags mammal]
		[tags genus="feline"]
			cat
			lion
			tiger
		[/tags]
		[tags genus="canine"]
			dog
			wolf
		[/tags]
	[/tags]
	[tags reptile lays_eggs]
		lizard
		turtle
		crocodile
	[/tags]
	[tags amphibian lays_eggs]
		newt
		salamander
		frog
	[/tags]
[/choose]
```

Then we update our filter to exclude the `feline` genus using the `!` operator:

```
[filter_tags mammal genus="!feline"]
```

With this setup, we will only get `dog` or `wolf` as a result.

As you can see, `[tags]` and `[filter_tags]` are very flexible - you can use them to create complex, multi-layered prompts that are easy to maintain.

For more information on these shortcodes, please consult the [Unprompted Manual](MANUAL.md).

Returns documentation for the requested feature or shortcode.

Each parg is a keyword that corresponds to the feature or shortcode you want to learn more about.

This shortcode is particularly useful in ComfyUI - you can connect the `STRING` output of the Unprompted node to a Preview Text node for an inline reference guide.

## System arguments

### _online

A parg that causes the shortcode to open relevant documentation in your web browser, rather than loading the Markdown files from disk.
